Overview
--------

This program is a solver for symmetric linear systems. It can be used to
obtain both the answer and residual. It's based on the block Cholesky decomposition
method. 

Several features were implemented to speed up the program:

1. Block matrix format that maximises the cache usage. For example, a matrix
   of the form

        a11 a12 ... a1n
        a21 a22 ... a2n
        ...
        an1 an2 ... ann

    is represented as a block matrix

        A11 A12 ... A1m
        A21 A22 ... A2m
        ...
        Am1 Am2 ... Amm

    where each block `Aij` is a matrix of `(block_size, block_size)` sizes.

    Some docs about the block algorithm can be found in the `doc` folder.

2. Loops are unrolled by 8 elements.

The matrix can be generated or read from a file. The right-hand side is
generated automatically by calculating the answer and then multiplying the
matrix by the answer vector.

Usage
-----

1. Makefile in `src` directory
2. `./a (matrix_size) (block_size) [matrix input file]`
